        How are the yurts furnished?

    <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience

        What should I bring?
      </strong>
    </dt>
    <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing.
      It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
